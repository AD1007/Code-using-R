I have conducted statistical forecasting on the share market prices of Microsoft
(MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) using ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and ETS methods on
real data from 2004-2014.
After analyzing the data, I fitted ARIMA models to both MSFT and SBUX share
prices. The ARIMA models suggested that both MSFT and SBUX share prices
exhibited seasonality and trend. The models forecasted that MSFT share prices
would continue to rise, with occasional fluctuations, and that SBUX share prices
would experience a decrease and then a gradual increase towards the end of the
time period.
Next, I used Holt-Winters models to forecast MSFT and SBUX share prices. The
models showed that MSFT share prices had an upward trend with an increase in
volatility, while SBUX share prices exhibited a decreasing trend with a decrease
in volatility. Overall, the models predicted that MSFT share prices would increase
over time, while SBUX share prices would remain relatively stable.
Lastly, I used ETS models to forecast MSFT and SBUX share prices. The models
revealed that MSFT share prices had a positive trend with a high level of volatility,
while SBUX share prices had a negative trend with a low level of volatility. The
models predicted that MSFT share prices would continue to increase, while SBUX
share prices would experience a slight decline before stabilizing towards the end of
the time period.
Overall, the statistical forecasting using ARIMA, Holt-Winters, and ETS methods
on real data from 2004-2014 suggests that MSFT share prices will continue to rise,
albeit with occasional fluctuations, while SBUX share prices will remain relatively
stable with a slight decline towards the end of the time period. However, itâ€™s
important to note that forecasting share prices is inherently uncertain, and other
factors beyond the scope of statistical modeling can also influence share prices.
